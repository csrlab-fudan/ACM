# Usage
## Quaternary ACM pair
  [a, b] = gen_quaternary_acm_pair(m, n);  
  - Input: m is the length in the first dimension, n is the length in the second dimension.  
  - Output: [a, b] is a quaternary ACM pair.  

## Binary ACM quad of size within 78 x 78
  [q1, q2, q3, q4] = gen_binary_acm_quad(m, n);  
  - Input: m is the length in the first dimension, n is the length in the second dimension.  
  - Output: [q1, q2, q3, q4] is a binary ACM quad.  

## Quaternary ACM quad of size s1t1 ×(s2 +s3)t2 where s1 ×s2, s1 ×s3 and t1 × t2 are the sizes of quaternary ACM pairs
  [q1, q2, q3, q4] = gen_quaternary_acm_quad(m, n);  
  - Input: m is the length in the first dimension, n is the length in the second dimension.  
  - Output: [q1, q2, q3, q4] is a quaternary ACM quad.  
## Quaternary ACM quad of size 24 x 799
[q1, q2, q3, q4] = quad_24x799;  
- Output: [q1, q2, q3, q4] is a quaternary ACM quad of size 24 x 799. 

## Quaternary ACM quad of size 24 x 959
[q1, q2, q3, q4] = quad_24x959;  
- Output: [q1, q2, q3, q4] is a quaternary ACM quad of size 24 x 959.
